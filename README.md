# HoloTagger

Web application for tagging and downloading karaoke covers sung by vtubers.  
The application consists of an API and simple web interface.  

It works by giving a link to a youtube video, after which the video is downloaded and converted into a mp3 file. 

The app also adds metadata to the song (e.g. thumbnail, artist, etc).  
The artist tag is generated by matching channel IDs from [vdb](https://vdb.vtbs.moe/) or fuzzy searching the video title (romaiji is also taken into account).

## Development

[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for package management. To setup the project for development, simply run:

```console
$ poetry install
```
in the project directory.

## Deployment

There are two entrypoint scripts:

- `entry/start.sh` for development, will run a http server on port 8000
- `entry/prod.sh` for running in a production environment, will run a http server on port 80

Deploying can be also be done using docker-compose.  
First create an `.env` in the root directory with:

```
YOUTUBE_DEVELOPER_KEY=<INSERT YOUR KEY>
```

Then run:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```
